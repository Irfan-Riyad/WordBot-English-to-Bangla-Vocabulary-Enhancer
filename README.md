WordBot: English to Bangla Vocabulary Enhancer
WordBot is a Python-based project that displays random English words at regular intervals and provides their corresponding Bangla translations. This can help users improve their vocabulary in both languages by learning new words along with their meanings.

Features
Fetches random English words from a large word list.
Translates the selected word into Bangla using a translation API.
Displays both the word and its Bangla meaning every hour (or based on a user-defined time interval).
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

Python 3.6+
pip (Python's package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository (or download the project files):

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wordbot-bangla-translator.git
cd wordbot-bangla-translator
Install the required dependencies:

Use pip to install the necessary Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install requests translate
How It Works
Word List: The project fetches a list of 10,000 random English words from an online resource provided by MIT (https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000).
Translation: For each random word, the project uses the translate library to translate the word into Bangla (bn language code).
Display: The selected word and its Bangla meaning are displayed at regular intervals (e.g., every hour or 3 seconds for testing).
Usage
To run the project, execute the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python wordbot.py
The script will show a new English word and its Bangla meaning based on the time interval you’ve set (default is 3 seconds for testing, but you can change it to 3600 seconds for hourly updates).

Customizing the Time Interval
By default, the word appears every 3 seconds. You can modify the time interval to your liking by changing the time.sleep() value in the script.

For example, to show a word every hour, update:

python
Copy code
time.sleep(3600)  # 3600 seconds = 1 hour
Example Output
vbnet
Copy code
Word: important
Meaning: গুরুত্বপূর্ণ

Next word in 3 seconds...

Word: solution
Meaning: সমাধান
Possible Enhancements
Add more language options for translation.
Store previously shown words and meanings to avoid repetition.
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
Save words and translations in a file or database for future reference.
